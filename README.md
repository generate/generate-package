## Quickstart

Install [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) and `generate-package`:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate generate-package
```

Generate a package.json in the current working directory:

```sh
$ gen package
```

## What is "Generate"?

Generate is a command line tool and developer framework for scaffolding out new GitHub projects using [generators](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/generators.md) and [tasks](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md).

Answers to prompts and the user's environment can be used to determine the templates, directories, files and contents to build. Support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) plugins, and much more.

**For more information**:

* Visit the [generate project](https://github.com/generate/generate/)
* Visit the [generate documentation](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/)
* Find [generators on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/generate-generator) (help us [author generators](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/micro-generators.md))

## Getting started

### Install

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `package` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [Generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

**Install generate-package**

Install this module with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate-package
```

### Usage

Run this generator's `default` [task](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md#default) with the following command:

```sh
$ gen package
```

**What you should see in the terminal**

If completed successfully, you should see both `starting` and `finished` events in the terminal, like the following:

```sh
[00:44:21] starting ...
...
[00:44:22] finished ✔
```

If you do not see one or both of those events, please [let us know about it](../../issues).

### Help

To see a general help menu and available commands for Generate's CLI, run:

```sh
$ gen help
```

## Tasks

All available tasks.

### [package](generator.js#L62)

Generate a [normalized](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/normalize-pkg) package.json file in the current working directory.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen package
# or
$ gen package:new
```

### [package:raw](generator.js#L93)

Generate a `package.json` without normalizing the result.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen package:raw
```

### [package:min](generator.js#L111)

Generate a minimal `package.json` file.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen package:min
```

### [package:sub](generator.js#L127)

Generate a `package.json` or a sub-directory in a project, with only `name`, `description` and `private` fields defined.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen package:sub
```

### [package:dev](generator.js#L144)

Generate a fake `package.json` file to use for development. All of the fields in this file are pre-populated with fake data.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen package:dev
```

### [package:choose](generator.js#L159)

Prompts the user to choose the template and fields to use for generating a `package.json` file.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen package:choose
```
